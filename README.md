**Regression Models with Keras** ðŸ“ˆðŸ¤–

**Overview**
This project focuses on implementing various regression models using neural networks with Keras. Regression analysis is a fundamental aspect of predictive modeling, and neural networks offer powerful tools for building accurate regression models. This repository provides implementations of different regression models using Keras, along with data preprocessing and evaluation techniques.

**Installation**
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/muizz8/Regression_Models_with_Keras.git
```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
```bash
cd Regression_Models_with_Keras
```
3. Install the required dependencies using pip:
```bash
pip install pandas keras numpy tensorflow
```

**Usage**
Once the installation is complete, you can explore the project by executing the main script or by running individual model scripts. Use Jupyter notebooks for detailed analysis and visualization.

```bash
python main.py
```
Make sure you have the necessary dataset files available in the data/ directory. You may need to preprocess the data before training the models.

**Structure**
The project directory is structured as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the dataset files used for training and testing.
- **models/**: Includes scripts for implementing various regression models using Keras.
- **utils/**: Contains utility functions used for data preprocessing, visualization, etc.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists all the Python dependencies required for the project.
